  <h1>HOMEPAGE</h1>
    <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Sean and this is my 1st year at IIT as a transfer student from COD.</p>
      <p>I'm studying to major in ITM and I hope that I get to know everyone here.</p>
      <p>I chose ITM because the field interests me and because my original plan for computer science ended up not being the path I wanted to take.</p>
      <p>Some of my hobbies include cars and 3d printers on top of kickboxing.</p>
	  <p>One of my dream goals is to finally own a Toyota GT86 which will most likely not happen given how impractical a 2+2 RWD coupe is in Chicago, especially in the winter</p>
