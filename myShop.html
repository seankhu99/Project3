	<h3>About the shop</h3>
	  <p>DIY Fingerboards is my little side shop that I run in my free time.</p>
	  <p>I have 11 years of fingerboarding under my belt, and more than 2 years experience of desiging molds.</p>
	  <p>My shop specializes in custom and premade 3d printed molds that allow for the creation of making your own wooden fingerboards.</p>
	  <p>The shop officially opened on <strong>December 10th, 2018.</strong></p>
	  <p>All molds are 3d printed out of PETG on a Prusa MK3S.</p>
	  <p>Molds have stainless steel pins for marking where to drill the holes on the pressed blank.</p>

	<h3>Charred Origins</h3>
	  <p>DIY Fingerboards only came to exist because of my journey in wanting to make fingerboards.</p>
	  <p>Before 3d printing, people would make molds from autobody filler or have it professionally machined from metal.</p>
	  <p>A mold from autobody filler is extremely finicky to shape by hand. Machining time isn't cheap either and not to mention you needed to have a STEP file of the mold to machine. The amount of people who can design fingerboard molds in the hobby is extremely limited and the information to do so isn't widely available.</p>
	  <p>I had originally paid someone who was self-professed to be an expert at designing fingerboard molds in CAD. Long story short the designer didn't know what he was doing and I was out $100 USD on top of being left with unusable files for machining or 3d printing.</p>
	  <p>Not wanting to get burned again, I sought out to learn how to do design this on my own. It wasn't easy, how do you learn something that doesn't have a tutorial or widely recognized specifications? Not to mention, I had practically no CAD experience at all.</p>
	  <p>It took about 2 years of on and off designing and prototyping to teach myself how to model fingerboard molds. Using Fusion 360, it was a battle learning the software on top of figuring out how to make molds. Having to figure out the hole spacing was the most critical part and I went through like ten revisions before I finally got it right. On a jobless freshman budget, it wasn't cheap and each prototype I had printed costed me time and my sanity.</p>
	  <p>Eventually I got it and with the encouragement and blessings from my friends and peers in the hobby, I launched DIY Fingerboaards.</p>

	<h3>The Shop Today</h3>
	  <p>Today, my shop is moderately successful all things considered. Fingerboards are not a huge hobby itself nor is it a very profitable one.</p>
	  <p>Despite this, my dream of making fingerboard making affordable for newcomers came true and it was worth the journey.</p>
	  <p>Through my shop I strengthened my existing friendships as well as made new ones with people I would've never met through other circumstances.</p>
	  <p>While college is draining my time and energy away from my shop, I hope that I can keep it open for years to come as my passion project first.</p>
